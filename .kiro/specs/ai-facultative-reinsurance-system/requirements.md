# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Facultative Reinsurance Decision Support System is designed to revolutionize the reinsurance business process by automating the analysis and decision-making for facultative reinsurance applications. The system will process various document types (PDFs, scanned PDFs, emails, Excel sheets) to extract and structure risk details, analyze exposures, and provide intelligent recommendations to underwriters.

Facultative reinsurance deals with high-value assets that cannot be fully insured by a single insurer, requiring careful risk assessment and decision-making. This system will streamline the process by leveraging AI technologies including OCR, document processing, and risk analysis models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Processing and OCR

**User Story:** As an underwriter, I want the system to automatically process various document formats so that I can quickly access structured data from facultative reinsurance applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text and structured data using OCR technology
2. WHEN a scanned PDF (image-based) is uploaded THEN the system SHALL use DOCTR OCR to convert images to text and extract relevant information
3. WHEN an email (.msg file) is uploaded THEN the system SHALL parse the email content and extract risk-related information
4. WHEN an Excel sheet is uploaded THEN the system SHALL read and process tabular data for risk analysis
5. IF document processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the user with specific failure reasons
6. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain original document integrity and provide audit trails

### Requirement 2: Data Extraction and Structuring

**User Story:** As a risk analyst, I want the system to automatically extract and structure risk details from processed documents so that I can focus on analysis rather than manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL identify and extract key risk parameters (asset value, location, type, coverage limits)
2. WHEN risk data is extracted THEN the system SHALL structure the information into standardized data models
3. WHEN multiple documents contain related information THEN the system SHALL consolidate and cross-reference the data
4. WHEN data extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL validate extracted information against business rules
5. IF extracted data is incomplete or inconsistent THEN the system SHALL flag issues for manual review
6. WHEN data is structured THEN the system SHALL store it in a searchable and reportable format

### Requirement 3: Risk Analysis and Assessment

**User Story:** As an underwriter, I want the system to automatically analyze risk factors, loss histories, catastrophe exposures, and financials so that I can make informed decisions quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN structured risk data is available THEN the system SHALL analyze historical loss patterns and trends
2. WHEN risk assessment is performed THEN the system SHALL evaluate catastrophe exposure based on geographic and asset type factors
3. WHEN financial data is processed THEN the system SHALL assess the financial strength and stability of the applicant
4. WHEN risk analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate risk scores and probability assessments
5. WHEN multiple risk factors are identified THEN the system SHALL provide weighted risk analysis considering all factors
6. IF risk analysis indicates high exposure THEN the system SHALL highlight specific concerns and mitigation recommendations

### Requirement 4: Business Limits and Constraints Validation

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to automatically validate applications against business limits and regulatory constraints so that we maintain compliance and risk management standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk assessment is performed THEN the system SHALL check against predefined business limits for asset values and coverage amounts
2. WHEN geographic risk is analyzed THEN the system SHALL validate against regional exposure limits
3. WHEN industry sector is identified THEN the system SHALL check sector-specific limits and restrictions
4. IF application exceeds business limits THEN the system SHALL automatically flag for senior review or rejection
5. WHEN limits validation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations for any limit violations
6. WHEN regulatory requirements apply THEN the system SHALL ensure compliance with relevant reinsurance regulations

### Requirement 5: Decision Support and Recommendations

**User Story:** As an underwriter, I want the system to provide intelligent recommendations (approve/reject) with supporting rationale so that I can make faster, more consistent decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a recommendation (approve, reject, or conditional approval)
2. WHEN a recommendation is made THEN the system SHALL provide detailed rationale and supporting evidence
3. WHEN conditional approval is recommended THEN the system SHALL suggest specific terms, conditions, or premium adjustments
4. WHEN rejection is recommended THEN the system SHALL clearly explain the reasons and risk factors leading to the decision
5. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores and uncertainty indicators
6. IF additional information is needed THEN the system SHALL specify what data would improve the decision accuracy

### Requirement 6: Multi-Agent Orchestration System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to use a multi-agent or Celery-based orchestration approach so that different processing tasks can run efficiently and independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL route them to appropriate processing agents based on document type
2. WHEN multiple processing tasks are required THEN the system SHALL execute them in parallel where possible
3. WHEN an agent completes a task THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger dependent downstream processes
4. IF an agent fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and error handling without affecting other agents
5. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL distribute tasks efficiently across available resources
6. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL consolidate results from all agents into a unified output

### Requirement 7: Market Grouping and Email Processing

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want scanned emails to be automatically grouped by markets so that I can analyze market-specific trends and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emails are processed THEN the system SHALL identify market indicators from email content and metadata
2. WHEN market classification is performed THEN the system SHALL group emails by geographic markets, industry sectors, or business lines
3. WHEN emails are grouped THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships between related communications
4. WHEN market analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated insights by market grouping
5. IF market classification is uncertain THEN the system SHALL flag emails for manual classification
6. WHEN market groups are established THEN the system SHALL enable filtering and reporting by market segments

### Requirement 8: Open Source Model Integration

**User Story:** As a technical architect, I want the system to use only open-source models for all AI functionality so that we maintain cost control and avoid vendor lock-in.

2. WHEN natural language processing is required THEN the system SHALL use open-source NLP models
3. WHEN risk analysis models are needed THEN the system SHALL implement or integrate open-source machine learning models
